# University of Ottawa Course Work
This is a repository of my work during my undergrad at the University of Ottawa
for the degree of Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering

First Year (2019-2020)
- ITI1120 - Intro. to Computing I (Python)
- ITI1121 - Intro. to Computing II (Java)
  - Few of these are able to be uploaded due to example code implemented from Professors, therefore some of these files may be non-functioning

Second Year (2020-2021)
- CSI2110 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)
- SEG2105 - Intro. to Software Engineering (Java)
- SEG2106 - Intro. to Software Construction (Java)

Third Year (2021-2022)
- CEG3155 - Digital Systems II (VHDL)*
- CEG3136 - Computer Architecture II (C and ARM Assembly)

*some files used are not owned by me. They belong to Dr. Rami Abielmona. They are uploaded for the labratories, and so are uploaded for functionality in that.
